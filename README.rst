Introduction
------------

This package provides the GitHub App integration for
`Kiwi TCMS Enterprise <https://github.com/MrSenko/kiwitcms-enterprise/>`_
and is designed to work only for multi-tenant environments!
You don't need this add-on in order to run Kiwi TCMS without extended
GitHub integration!

Communication from GitHub to this plugin is via webhooks.

Plugin behavior:

- Auto-configure which tenant to use for database operations, either
  'public' or a single private tenant to which user has access.
- If unable to auto-configure display warning and redirect to configuration
  page once the GitHub account who installed this integration onto their
  GitHub repository logs into Kiwi TCMS
- Existing & newly created repositories are added as products in Kiwi TCMS
- BugSystem records are automatically configured for repositories
- Fork repositories are skipped
- Newly created git tags are added as product versions in Kiwi TCMS


See `Issues <https://github.com/kiwitcms/github-app/issues>`_ for other ideas!


Installation
------------

::

    pip install kiwitcms-github-app

inside Kiwi TCMS's docker image and make sure the following settings are configured::

    AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = [
        'social_core.backends.github.GithubAppAuth',
        ...
    ]
    SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_APP_KEY = 'xxxxxx'
    SOCIAL_AUTH_GITHUB_APP_SECRET = 'yyy'
    KIWI_GITHUB_APP_SECRET = b'your-webhook-secret'
    KIWI_GITHUB_APP_ID = 123456
    KIWI_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY = """-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
    +++++++++base64-encoded-private-key+++++++
    -----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----"""

everything else will be taken care for by Kiwi TCMS plugin loading code!


GitHub App configuration
------------------------

This plugin needs an existing GitHub App application with the following
configuration:

- User authorization callback URL: https://tcms.example.com/complete/github-app/
- Request user authorization (OAuth) during installation - True
- Webhook Active - True
- Webhook URL - https://tcms.example.com/kiwitcms_github_app/webhook/
- Webhook Secret - <the value of KIWI_GITHUB_APP_SECRET>
- SSL verification - Enabled

Then configure how the application interacts with GitHub:

- Repository permissions:

  - Contents: Read-only
  - Issues: Read & write (required for 1-click bug report on private repos)
  - Metadata: Read-only

- User permissions:

  - Email addresses: Read-only

- Subscribe to events:

  - Meta
